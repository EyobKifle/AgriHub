            <h3>Why Raise Chickens?</h3>
            <p>Chickens are a great way to get fresh eggs and meat. They are small, grow fast, and don't need a lot of space. Selling extra eggs and chickens at the local market can provide a good, steady income for your family.</p>

            <h3>Practical Steps for Raising Chickens</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Choose Your Chickens:</strong> You can start with local Ethiopian chickens (they are strong and find their own food) or improved breeds like Bovans or Lohmann (they lay more eggs but need more care and better feed).</li>
                <li><strong>Build a Safe House:</strong> A good chicken house (coop) protects them from rain, sun, and predators like wild cats or birds of prey. It should be clean, dry, and have a place for them to sleep (perch) and lay eggs (nesting box). Use wood, mud, and wire mesh that you can find locally.</li>
                <li><strong>Provide Clean Food and Water:</strong> Give your chickens clean water every day. You can feed them maize, wheat bran, and leftover food from your kitchen. For better egg production, you can buy special chicken feed.</li>
                <li><strong>Keep it Clean:</strong> Clean the chicken house every week. Remove old droppings and wet bedding. A clean house prevents diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Watch for Sickness:</strong> Healthy chickens are active and have bright eyes. If a chicken looks sick (it is quiet, not eating, or has ruffled feathers), separate it from the others immediately to stop the disease from spreading. Ask a local animal health worker for advice.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Local Tips for Ethiopian Farmers</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Vaccination is Important:</strong> Newcastle disease (<em>Fengil</em>) is very common and can kill all your chickens. Get your chicks vaccinated. It is cheap and very effective.</li>
                <li><strong>Protect Your Chicks:</strong> Young chicks need to be kept warm and safe. Keep them in a separate, warm area for the first few weeks.</li>
                <li><strong>Use the Droppings:</strong> Chicken manure is excellent fertilizer for your vegetable garden. Don't throw it away! Mix it with soil to help your crops grow.</li>
